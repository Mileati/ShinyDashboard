 About Data:

This is a simulated data containing 10 of the most important biological features that were obtained from recursive feature elimination using random forest as a base model to rank feature importance to predict risk of readmission within 30 days since discharge in patients who underwent CABG. The data contains 5605 patients.

Relevance

CABG is commonly performed in the United States and globally. Readmission could compromise health outcomes of patients as well as increase health care costs. Therefore, having a model to assess risk could assist in better data driven decision making that could positively impact health care outcomes and reduce health care costs. However, this is not meant to assist in clinical settings as the model is not robust, and several reservations remain.
